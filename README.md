# FlightSystem
This is a project I did for Uni. It is a flight seat booking system where you can book seats for numerous flight times. Written in C++. 

It is a simple user input based program that lets the user choose a flight time and then a seat for the flight. The seat will then be
reserved for that passenger and the user will be promted to enter another seat number when trying to book the occupied seat whilst 
booking a second ticket.

To use this you can copy and paste the cody from fligthbookingsystem.txt into any c++ compatible text editor and compile to run it.
You can also use the Clion project folder and open it up in your Clion.
